## Project description

The objective of this project is to develop a web application for leeping records of bus maintanance procedures based on a questionnaire created by the company. The answers are saved on the database relating the form id to the user that answered the questionnaire. Later on the user can access the questionnaire and create PDF files with the answers and images.

## Database

For this project, we're using MongoDB to create our database and hold the project's data. To connect the project and the database, we're using FastAPI for developing the routes and main HTTP request/responses functions.
